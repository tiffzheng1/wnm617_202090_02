			Hi there! I am someone who has always been fascinated by design. My first passion was graphic design, which was the world of Photoshop: photo-editing, lots of brochures, and Facebook cover photos. I became more interested in digital design while I was working at a marketing start-up. I found myself excited about audience research, wireframes and prototypes, and ultimately, that is why I decided to move to San Francisco to pursue my Masters in Web Design & New Media (and totally enjoying the west coast weather)!<br><br><strong>TLDR:</strong> I have 3+ years doing graphic design. Currently, I'm working as a digital graphic designer at a marketing agency in LA, as well as freelancing as a UI designer for multiple projects.<br><br>Outside of design work, I spend my free time learning how to play golf, learning Korean, and most of all, learning how to make the best cup of coffee.
